# critical_service_analysis

The purpose of this program is to determine if different populations within New Zealand have to travel different distances from their residence to access critical services. Research has established that requiring further travel to critical services can have significant negative impacts to an individual such as lowered mental health, decrease in utilisation of medical services and increased risk of obesity.

This demonstrates the importance of determining if there are any demographics within New Zealand which are disproportionately burdened with further distances to critical services.
