# critical_service_analysis

The purpose of this program is to determine if different populations within New Zealand are disproportionately burdened with further distances to critical services from their residences. This was analysed because research has established that requiring further travel to critical services can have significant negative impacts to an individual such as lowered mental health, decrease in utilisation of medical services and increased risk of obesity.
